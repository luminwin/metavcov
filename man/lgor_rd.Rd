\description{
Compute covariance between log odds ratio and risk difference, when the two outcomes are binary.
}
\arguments{
\item{r }{ Correlation coefficient of the two outcomes.}
\item{n1c }{ Number of participants reporting outcome 1 in control group.}
\item{n2c }{ Number of participants reporting outcome 2 in control group.}
\item{n1t }{ Number of participants reporting outcome 1 in treatment group.}
\item{n2t }{ Number of participants reporting outcome 2 in treatment group.}
\item{n12c }{ Number of participants reporting both outcome 1 and outcome 2 in control group. By default, it is equal to the smaller number between n1c and n2c.}
\item{n12t }{ Number defined in a similar way as n12c for treatment group. }
\item{s2c }{ Number of participants with event for outcome 2 (dichotomous) in control group.}
\item{s2t }{ Defined in a similar way as s2c for treatment group. }
\item{f2c }{ Number of participants without event for outcome 2 (dichotomous) in control group.}
\item{f2t }{ Defined in a similar way as f2c for treatment group }
\item{s1c }{ Number of participants with event for outcome 1 (dichotomous) in control group.}
\item{s1t }{ Defined in a similar way as s1c for treatment group. }
\item{f1c }{ Number of participants without event for outcome 1 (dichotomous) in control group.}
\item{f1t }{ Defined in a similar way as f1c for treatment group. }
}

\value{
Return the computed covariance.
