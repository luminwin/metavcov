\title{18 studies of correlation coefficients reported by Craft et al. (2003)}
\description{
This dataset includes 18 studies of correlation coefficients reported by Craft, Magyar, Becker, and
Feltz (2003).}
  \usage{data(Craft2003)}
\details{The main purpose of Craft and colleagues (2003) meta-analysis was to examine the interrelationships between athletic performance and three subscales, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-concept, of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory (CSAI 2; CITATION). In this meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient was the primary effect size measure. For the purpose of demonstration, I use a subset of the data, i.e., six correlation coefficients among cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, self-concept, and sport performance in athletes.
